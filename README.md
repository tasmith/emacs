My Emacs configurations

I change my Emacs configuration frequently. Sometimes it is small and simple and sometimes it is large and 
complex. I've experimented with *org-mode* literate configurations and configurations that are slight modifications
of more sophisticated ones authored by others. I even give up and run vanilla Spacemacs or Doom-emacs configurations
occasionally. 

Right now, I'm building a new configuration (it's completely unstable currently and not recommended for use by others).
This configuration is based on the very nice centaur-emacs by Vincent Zhang (https://github.com/seagle0128). However, I've
broken a number of parts and am adding my own hacks to it so please see the original for a better experience.
