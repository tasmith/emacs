The `.emacs.d' files actually found in a directory named something else; in this case `todd3'. This allows
easy switching between Emacs configurations by simply symlinking `todd3' to to '~/.emacs.d'. Other configurations are 
found sibling directories of 'todd3'. Switching Emacs configurations is then easy by just symlinking another configuration
over target '.emacs.d' (this can be somewhat automated by using GNU stow as well).
